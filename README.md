# Telecom Company Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement
This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. One can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs. A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving them for their competitors.
Our task is to find out who is leaving and why they are leaving.

So, we need to use the Churn data from a telecom company to understand what factors are good predictors of churn. Use a logistic regression model to build the best model (that is best in terms of model fit criteria).

## I answered the following questions after analyzing the data
* Include a table of coefficients, t-values, and odds ratio. Interpret the logistic output explaining AIC/BIC, meaning of coefficients, significance, prediction accuracy (percent concordance), odds-ratios etc.
* Which are the top three factors that affect churn in your model.
* What other variables (that if collected) would help to improve the fit of the model.
* Compute the hit ratio for your model. Hit ratio is defined as the percentage of correct predictions using the logit model. Use the model to predict 1 or 0 using the same data.
